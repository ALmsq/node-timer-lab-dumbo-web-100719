# Name

In this lab, we'll using `process` and timer functions to build a command-line interface application which take number of second or minutes and counts them down.

## Objectives

1. Implement Node timer app which works from CLI (take time and counts down like a kitchen timer)
1. Implement taking the CLI arguments
1. Implement the async sleep
1. Implement the current coutdown 


## Introduction

By now you should now how to access CLI arguments and use `setTimeout()`. Let's get to building the Timer app!

## Instructions

1. Create a CLI app which takes number of seconds in the following format: ns for n seconds, e.g., and 5s for five seconds. The command must look like `$ node timer 5s`.
2. Implement the timer by printing the number of seconds left on a new line (in terminal / command prompt). The file name must be `timer.js`.
3. Test the CLI with `$ npm test`
4. Enhance the app by adding minutes in the following format nmin, e.g., 1min for 1 minute. The command must look like `$ node timer 1min`.
